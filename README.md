## Description

This is a very simple interface designed to display a list of videos with the following descriptive information:
- Video title
- Author
- Duration in hours/minutes
- Associated category
- Video viewed or not

You can also apply filters to the title, author and/or category.
In addition, you can order the list of videos by each of the fields (e.g. order by title, from A to Z), by clicking on the associated field.

## Use

- Download the repository
- Fill in the `videos` table on line 47 of the `index.html` file as you wish, but respect the format indicated.
- Open `index.html` using a browser
- That's all there is to it =)

## Current limits

- You cannot order by several criteria (e.g. order by title AND by author).
- Only one category can be assigned to each video.

## Coming soon

- Add a button to reset all filters in one click
